Ques (1): What is Internet? Explin in your own words.
Soul (1): The internet is a global network of computers and servers that connect to each other and allow communication and exchange of information through the World Wide Web (WWW). It enables users to access and share information, communicate with each other, conduct online transactions and perform a multitude of other activities from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. The internet has become an integral part of our daily lives and has transformed the way we live, work, and communicate.

Ques (2): What is a web browser? Explain in your own words.
Solu (2): A web browser is a software application that allows users to access, retrieve, and view information on the internet. It acts as a window to the internet, enabling users to visit websites, view web pages, and interact with online content such as videos, images, and text. The browser takes the user's request for a website, sends it to the appropriate server, and then retrieves and displays the resulting web page on the user's device. Some of the most popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari. A web browser makes it easy for people to navigate and use the internet, as it provides a graphical user interface for accessing information and services online.

Ques (3): What is a browser engine? Explain in your own words.
Solu (3): A browser engine is the part of a web browser that is responsible for rendering web pages and executing JavaScript code. It acts as a translator between the web content, written in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the browser, allowing the user to view the page in a format that is visually appealing and easy to interact with. The browser engine takes the web page's code and converts it into a display that can be viewed on the user's device. Some popular browser engines include Blink (used by Google Chrome), Gecko (used by Mozilla Firefox), and WebKit (used by Apple Safari). The browser engine is an important component of a web browser as it determines how quickly and accurately web pages will be displayed, and it can also affect the performance of the browser itself.

Ques (4): What is a static site? Explain in your own words.
Solu (4): A static website is a type of website that consists of fixed, pre-written HTML pages. Unlike dynamic websites, which are generated on-the-fly in response to user requests, the content on a static website remains the same every time the page is loaded. Static websites are typically used for simple sites that do not require frequent updates or the collection of user data, such as personal blogs, portfolios, or informational sites.

Static websites are generally faster and more secure than dynamic websites, as they do not rely on server-side scripting or databases. They are also easier to host, as they do not require special server-side software or configurations. However, they can be limited in terms of functionality and scalability compared to dynamic websites, as they do not allow for real-time updates or personalized content for individual users.

Ques (5): What is a dynamic site? Explain in your own words.
Solu (5): A dynamic website is a type of website that generates its content on-the-fly in response to user requests. Unlike static websites, whose content remains the same every time the page is loaded, dynamic websites can display different content depending on the user's actions or the time of day. Dynamic websites are typically used for more complex sites, such as online stores, social networking sites, and news websites, that require frequent updates and the collection of user data.

Dynamic websites are powered by server-side scripting languages, such as PHP or Ruby on Rails, and databases, such as MySQL or MongoDB. When a user requests a page on a dynamic website, the server processes the request and generates a custom response, which is then sent back to the user's browser to be displayed. This allows dynamic websites to display personalized content, real-time updates, and a wide range of interactive features, such as user profiles, shopping carts, and forums.
